                <p>A simple letter for my special girl who has made days better.</p>
                <p>Happy birthday to you. Here are some of the reasons why I love you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have made me smile countless times even when I don't feel like it.</li>
                    <li>You have this effect on me that I can't really explain.</li>
                    <li>I fell in love with your smile, and I get giddy just thinking about it.</li>
                    <li>Your laugh is contagious, even if I have no idea what you're laughing at, I'll still smile and laugh too, cause I love seeing you happy.</li>
                    <li>I love everything about you, from the way you talk to the way you make me feel. Words can never describe the love I feel for you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whenever I see you, there is only one song that goes in my head: "Mere Liye Tum Kafi Ho".</p>
                <p>I wish you achieve a lot of success in life and always stay with me. Believe in yourself, stay strong, and whenever life gives you problems, just remember I'm always there with you no matter what. I wish nothing but absolute happiness for you now and for the years to come.</p>
                <p>I met the happiest version of myself when I met you. You are like the song "Kun Faya Kun," and your smile is like the "Sajra Savera" part.</p>
                <p>Happy birthday, Lopa...</p>
